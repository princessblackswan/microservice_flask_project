# microservice_flask_project
Hi everyone, these are simple API endpoints for a hypothetical online library system with simple integration with Langchain to automatically generate book summary and recommendation on demand

Suitable for beginners learning flask.

Pls ensure to:
- Setup a new environment and install the required packages at requirements.txt 
- create a folder called static, within it create another folder called img. This is to store the image files uploaded by user
- You can use Postman or Thunder Client to test each endpoints so pls have them installed

Please contact me if you have any issues
